Compromises
Scrapy "Allowed domains" effectively limits the crawling to the host domain but restricts the recording of external
links, further time and experimentation with the framework required to support this requirement.

Execution

Once pulled cd into the top level scraper folder

$ scrapy crawl simplecrawl
 or
$ scrapy crawl --nolog simplecrawl
to remove log "noise" on execution

The settings within settings.py have been adjusted to automatically create a time stamped json output of the run within
the data subfolder structure e.g. ./data/simplecrawl/2017-03-12T11-16-45.json. This is achieved by the settings

FEED_URI = 'data/%(name)s/%(time)s.json'
FEED_FORMAT = 'json'

Next steps - Scrapy code

Solve the external links compromise e.g. through controlling search critera and search depth past the domain limit
either within the Rules for the LinkExtractor class or within the crawl loop.
Extend the information capture structure and tune the Xpath's for more efficient parsing
Amend the output process to offer more flexible options, either through Pipelines or potentially through parameters in
settings.py
Change the 'Allowed Domain' and 'Start URL' to data feed
Explore parallel concurrent feeds

Next steps - Implementation
Restructure the output to feed into an Elastic instance
Containerise the implementation
Restructure the send/receive mechanism to utilise a queue mechanism for scaling of concurrent async crawls. Initial
candidates would be Kafka, Redis or Rabbit

Next step investigations

Investigate the Apache Nutch option from an enterprise framework, potential to short circuit the level of coding
required.
Look at an alternate visualisation method, either via ELK or one of the Django or Scrapy extensions
